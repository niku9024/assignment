    <h1>Section 1:My Favorite Hobby</h1>
    <hr><hr>
    <p>One of my favorite hobbies is <b>coding and working on technical projects</b>. I find immense satisfaction in building something from scratch, whether it's a small script to automate a task or a full-fledged application that solves a real-world problem. Coding gives me the creative freedom to explore, experiment, and innovate, which keeps me constantly engaged and curious.</p>
    <p>Whenever I get some free time, <u>I like to challenge myself with new technologies or programming problems. I often participate in hackathons, online coding contests, and collaborative projects with my peers</u>. These experiences not only help sharpen my technical skills but also improve my problem-solving abilities and teamwork. <b>Each project teaches me something new — sometimes it's about logic and algorithms, and other times it's about communication and presentation.</b>
<br><br>
<i><u> <mark>What I love most about this hobby is that it's constantly evolving. There's always something new to learn — a new programming language, a better framework, or an emerging trend in the tech world.</u></mark></i> Staying updated and continuously learning keeps me motivated and inspired. It also gives me a sense of purpose, especially when I can apply my knowledge to build solutions that help others.</p>
