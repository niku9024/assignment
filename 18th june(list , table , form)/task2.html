     <h3>A short description:</h3>
     <p>Atomic Habits" by James Clear is a self-help book that emphasizes how small, consistent changes in daily behavior can lead to significant long-term results. The core idea is that improving just 1% every day can compound into major transformation over time. Rather than focusing on big goals, the book encourages building better systems and forming identity-based habitsâ€”where you align your habits with the person you want to become. It explains how habits are formed through a loop of cue, craving, response, and reward, and offers practical strategies to make good habits easier and bad habits harder. The book blends psychology, neuroscience, and real-life examples to show how anyone can design an environment and routine that supports lasting positive change.</p>
